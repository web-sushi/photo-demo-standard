              <p class="about-story">
                Last month, I photographed an intimate wedding celebration for
                30 people in a small garden venue in Tokyo. The couple had one
                request: "We want to feel like you're not even there." This is
                my favorite kind of event to photograph, one where I can blend
                into the background and capture moments as they naturally
                unfold.
              </p>

              <h3>The Documentary Approach</h3>
              <p class="about-story">
                When I photograph events, I think of myself as a quiet observer
                rather than a director. I don't ask people to pose or repeat
                moments. Instead, I watch for the genuine interactions, the way
                someone's face lights up during a toast, the quiet conversation
                between friends, the spontaneous laughter that happens when no
                one's watching.
              </p>
              <p class="about-story">
                This approach requires patience and awareness. I'm constantly
                scanning the room, anticipating moments before they happen. I
                position myself where I can capture the emotion without being
                intrusive. Sometimes that means standing back with a longer
                lens. Sometimes it means being close enough to feel the energy,
                but invisible enough to not affect it.
              </p>

              <h3>Reading the Room</h3>
              <p class="about-story">
                Every event has its own rhythm. Some moments are quiet and
                contemplative. Others are energetic and fast-moving. Learning to
                read the room and match its energy is crucial. During the
                ceremony, I'm still and observant. During the reception, I'm
                more mobile, following the action as it moves.
              </p>
              <p class="about-story">
                I also pay attention to the light throughout the day. Natural
                light changes, and I need to adapt. I might use available window
                light during the ceremony, then move to capture golden hour
                portraits, then work with ambient reception lighting. The key is
                being flexible and working with what's there, not against it.
              </p>

              <h3>The Details That Tell the Story</h3>
              <p class="about-story">
                While I focus on people and emotion, I also capture the details
                that tell the story, the handwritten place cards, the flowers
                arranged on tables, the way the light falls on the cake. These
                details add context and depth to the narrative. They're the
                supporting characters in the story.
              </p>
              <p class="about-story">
                But I'm selective. I don't photograph every detail. I look for
                the ones that feel meaningful, the ones that the couple will
                remember and that add to the story we're telling. A few
                well-chosen detail shots are more powerful than dozens of
                generic ones.
              </p>

              <h3>Creating Trust</h3>
              <p class="about-story">
                The most important part of event photography is creating trust.
                When people trust that you're there to capture their genuine
                moments, not to create staged scenes, they relax. They forget
                about the camera. They become themselves. And that's when the
                best photographs happen.
              </p>
              <p class="about-story">
                I always meet with clients before the event to understand their
                vision and set expectations. I explain my approach and answer
                any questions. By the day of the event, we're comfortable with
                each other, and I can work naturally without constant direction.
              </p>

              <h3>The Result</h3>
              <p class="about-story">
                When I deliver the images, I want clients to feel like they're
                reliving the day, not just looking at photographs of it. The
                goal is to capture not just what happened, but how it felt—the
                emotion, the energy, the quiet moments and the loud ones.
              </p>
              <p class="about-story">
                The couple from this event told me later that looking through
                their photos felt like being back in those moments. That's the
                highest compliment I can receive. It means I did my job, I was
                present enough to capture the truth, and invisible enough to not
                change it.
